# Turbo

turbo is a thingÂ©

## Post Clone

    If you haven't linked you local components, you should do that first. Check out the `turbo-components` repo for instructions.

After pulling this repository to your machine, you should link the components repo dependency by running `npm link turbo-components` in the repo directory. This will tell node to resolve `require('turbo-components')` to you local component repository instead of to `node_modules`.
